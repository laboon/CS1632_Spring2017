# CS 1632 - Software Quality Assurance
Spring Semester 2017

DUE 17 APR 2017

## Deliverable 6

The demand for Befunge developers has grown far beyond our wildest dreams.  Therefore, we will be releasing our Befunge IDE to the world as part of our new startup, C-137 Industries.  For this assignment, you and a partner have been made Directors of Quality for the release of the Befunge IDE.

You will develop an entire testing strategy for the application.  This testing strategy should cover all aspects of testing that we have covered.  It should show that you have thought deeply about the particular concerns of this piece of software.

You should do independent research to determine general information about other IDEs that have been released and what kinds of issues they have experienced.  These can be IDEs for other (lesser) languages, such as Eclipse or Netbeans for Java.  However, some companies can be very secretive.  You may make up specifics if you cannot find that information (e.g., you can't find what language a particular IDE is written in).  IF YOU DO INCLUDE ANY MADE-UP FACTS, YOU MUST INDICATE IT IN THE PAPER.

Please remember to think about all aspects of testing and test strategies, as well as thinking what kind of function and non-functional requirements might be most relevant to C-137 Industries.  You may wish to review the syllabus to see all of the kinds of testing that we have discussed this semester and when they are relevant.

You must cite any sources that you use.  I do not care if you use MLA, Chicago, APA, IEEE, or any other citation style, but I should be able to look up your citations myself.

Your paper should include the following three sections.  You should LABEL each section clearly.  You may use graphs, charts, etc. if these would help in understanding your position.

1. A review of the program's overall quality.  This should be done using the Red-Yellow-Green template.  It is up to you to determine the subsets of functionality and/or subsystems.
2. Areas of concern and priority (e.g., security is extremely important for a bank versus a social networking site - what kinds of ).  We want the program to compare favorably in terms of features and quality with .  This section should include at least five still-existing defects AND/OR enhancements.  These should be written using the standard defect/enhancement template.
3. Testing strategies, e.g.:
   1. What kinds of tests should you have?
   1. How many testers do you want to have?
   1. What kind of experience should those testers have?
   2. What percentage of time/effort should be allocated to each kind of test?
   3. Should you bring in outside help (e.g. consultants) to test?
   4. What kind of management structure should you use?
   5. What recommendations would you give to help increase quality?
   6. What parts of the code need to be cleaned up?
   7. What kinds of things did you discover in exploratory testing?

You do not need to write out a specific test plan, unit tests, etc., but should state what kinds of things you would test, what edge cases, etc., and where you would test them.  You may want to review the Befunge-93 specification ( http://catseye.tc/view/befunge-93/doc/Befunge-93.markdown )to help you think of edge and corner cases.  You may also want to find other Befunge-93 programs and run them to see if you can find other defects.

In regards to enhancements, you have all spent time developing programs - what do you wish this IDE has that it does not have?

This paper should be approximately 6-7 pages in length (double-spaced).

## Format
Every assignment should have a title page with:
* The name of the students in the group
* The title "CS 1632 - DELIVERABLE 6: Test Strategy for Befunge IDE"

## Grading
```
Overall review of quality: 20%
Description of issues and enhancements: 35%
Description of testing strategy: 35%
General quality (readable, no grammatical errors, etc.): 10%
```
